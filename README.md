# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL-
Nashville Housing Data Cleaning using MySQl Workbench;
The project involved the use of the SELECT,FROM and WHERE clauses as well   SQl syntax for instance; case statements,coalesce Substring,locate, Substring_index to clean columns in the table then altering and updating the table with the new columns.
I also identified duplicates using window function ROW_Number() and removed unused columns.
